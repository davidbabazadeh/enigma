I WAS SCARED OF DENTISTS AND THE DARK
I WAS SCARED OF PRETTY GIRLS AND STARTING CONVERSATIONS
OH, ALL MY FRIENDS ARE TURNING GREEN
YOU RE THE MAGICIAN S ASSISTANT IN THEIR DREAM
AH-OOH-OOH-OOH, AH-AHH-AH-AH
AND THEY COME UNSTUCK
LADY, RUNNING DOWN TO THE RIPTIDE
TAKEN AWAY TO THE DARK SIDE
I WANNA BE YOUR LEFT HAND MAN
I LOVE YOU WHEN YOU RE SINGING THAT SONG
AND I GOT A LUMP IN MY THROAT
 CAUSE YOU RE GONNA SING THE WORDS WRONG
THERE S THIS MOVIE THAT I THINK YOU LL LIKE
THIS GUY DECIDES TO QUIT HIS JOB AND HEADS TO NEW YORK CITY
THIS COWBOY S RUNNING FROM HIMSELF
AND SHE S BEEN LIVING ON THE HIGHEST SHELF
AH-OOH-OOH-OOH, AH-AHH-OH
AND THEY COME UNSTUCK
LADY, RUNNING DOWN TO THE RIPTIDE
TAKEN AWAY TO THE DARK SIDE
I WANNA BE YOUR LEFT HAND MAN
I LOVE YOU WHEN YOU RE SINGING THAT SONG
AND I GOT A LUMP IN MY THROAT
 CAUSE YOU RE GONNA SING THE WORDS WRONG
I JUST WANNA, I JUST WANNA KNOW
IF YOU RE GONNA, IF YOU RE GONNA STAY
I JUST GOTTA, I JUST GOTTA KNOW
I CAN T HAVE IT, I CAN T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY
I SWEAR SHE S DESTINED FOR THE SCREEN
CLOSEST THING TO MICHELLE PFEIFFER THAT YOU VE EVER SEEN, OH
LADY, RUNNING DOWN TO THE RIPTIDE
TAKEN AWAY TO THE DARK SIDE
I WANNA BE YOUR LEFT HAND MAN
I LOVE YOU WHEN YOU RE SINGING THAT SONG
AND I GOT A LUMP IN MY THROAT
 CAUSE YOU RE GONNA SING THE WORDS WRONG
OH LADY, RUNNING DOWN TO THE RIPTIDE
TAKEN AWAY TO THE DARK SIDE
I WANNA BE YOUR LEFT HAND MAN
I LOVE YOU WHEN YOU RE SINGING THAT SONG
AND I GOT A LUMP IN MY THROAT
 CAUSE YOU RE GONNA SING THE WORDS WRONG
OH LADY, RUNNING DOWN TO THE RIPTIDE
TAKEN AWAY TO THE DARK SIDE
I WANNA BE YOUR LEFT HAND MAN
I LOVE YOU WHEN YOU RE SINGING THAT SONG
AND I GOT A LUMP IN MY THROAT
 CAUSE YOU RE GONNA SING THE WORDS WRONG
YEAH, I GOT A LUMP IN MY THROAT
 CAUSE YOU RE GONNA SING THE WORDS WRONG
